# AniCreate

Built to create animations for [Tropadom2](https://github.com/Jester565/Tropadom2), AniCreate uses a rugged 2D motion capture method I came up with.  By placing colored points in a monochromatic suit, user movement was tracked and converted in image location and rotation.  You can track using any video to animate any images.  Here is a video of me using the program (I'm going to look ridulous, but thats just motion capture):
